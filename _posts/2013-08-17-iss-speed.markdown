# How Far Does the ISS Go In ...

The [International Space Station](http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/k-4/stories/what-is-the-iss-k4.html) is in low Earth orbit traveling almost 8 km/s relative to the the surface of the Earth. Just how fast is that?

## ISS Speed

The average height of the ISS is around 413 km<sup>[<a href="#references">1</a>]</sup>. For a circular orbit around the Earth orbital speed is

$$v = \sqrt{\frac{G~M_{Earth}}{r}}$$


{% highlight python %}
from math import sqrt

G = 6.67384e-11   # m3 kg-1 s-2  Gravitational Constant
M = 5.972e24      # kg  Mass of the Earth
R_e = 6371e3      # m   Radius of the Earth
R_iss = 412e3     # m   Height of the ISS

v_iss = sqrt((G*M)/(R_e + R_iss))

print "%0.0f m/s" % v_iss
{% endhighlight %}

<div class="output">
<pre>
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span> 7665 m/s
</pre>
</div>

At that speed, how far does the ISS go in x seconds? We can make a little convenience function


{% highlight python %}
def iss(s):
    return v_iss * s # speed times time in seconds

print "In one tenth of a second the ISS moves %0.1f meters" % iss(0.1)
{% endhighlight %}

<div class="output">
<pre>
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span> In one tenth of a second the ISS moves 766.5 meters
</pre>
</div>

## Faster than a speeding bullet

Lets say we have a pretty standard 22 rifle with a 0.48 meter long barel.<sup>[<a href="#references">2</a>]</sup> Lets use standard .22 LR rounds which have a muzzle velocity of about 343 m/s.<sup>[<a href="#references">3</a>]</sup> If we assume that the bullet accelerates smoothly in the barrel then it should take

$$t = \frac{2x}{v_{muzzle}}$$

seconds to leave the end of the rifle after pulling the trigger.


{% highlight python %}
x = 0.48   # m  muzzle length
v = 343.0  # m/s muzzle velocity

t = (2*x)/v

print "A .22 LR takes about %0.5f seconds to leave the barrel" % t
{% endhighlight %}

<div class="output">
<pre>
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span> A .22 LR takes about 0.00280 seconds to leave the barrel
</pre>
</div>

Meanwhile the ISS has been traveling ...


{% highlight python %}
print "In that time the ISS moves %0.1f meters" % iss(t)
{% endhighlight %}

<div class="output">
<pre>
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span> In that time the ISS moves 21.5 meters
</pre>
</div>
