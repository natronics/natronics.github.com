A cute passphrase generator using space words.

 - [github repository](https://github.com/natronics/space-phrase)


## [List of Rocket Clubs](Rocket-Clubs) (2014)

An attempt to maintain a list of advanced rocket/aerospace clubs building impressive hardware.

 - [github repository](https://github.com/natronics/Rocket-Clubs)


## [Science Hack Day SF 2014](science-hack-day-2014)

I was at SHD San Fransisco 2014 and [worked on these projects](science-hack-day-2014)

 - [github repository](https://github.com/natronics/science-hack-day-2014)


## [NASA Style Switch Guards](NASA-switch-guard) (2013)

A 3D-printable version of NASA's awesome looking toggle switch guards so you don't accidentally hit a switch in orbit.

 - [github repository](https://github.com/natronics/NASA-switch-guard)


## [Earth Observatory Photos](EOL-Photos) (2013)

Now defunct. Was an attempt at a photo browser for NASA's Earth Observation Laboratory.

 - Legacy instance: <http://eol-browser.herokuapp.com/>
 - [github repository](https://github.com/natronics/EOL-Photos)


## Mars Science laboratory Image Feed (2012)

Now defunct. I put this together in an afternoon to track new images coming from
MSL after she landed. It worked for a little bit, but JPL kept changing their
layout and I couldn't keep up with the scraper.

## Portland State Aerospace Society 

For many, many years I've been working with [Portland State Aerospace Society](http://psas.pdx.edu/),
an educational group dedicated to building advanced avionics for high powered rockets.

I've been involved, in many cases integrally, in almost every aspect of the rocket. From data analysis, to fabricating parts, to group management.

Some highlight projects I've worked on:

 - Primary Flight Computer, written in c, flown on several flights <https://github.com/psas/av3-fc>
 - Reusable PSAS telemetry packet encoder <https://github.com/psas/psas_packet>
 - Live telemetry viewer, python backend, JavaScript front end <https://github.com/psas/telemetry>
 - Printable list of launch weekend procedures, using jekyll, pandoc, and pdf tools <https://github.com/psas/procedure-book>


And much more: <http://psas.pdx.edu/projects/>
