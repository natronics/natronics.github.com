## [Space Phrase](space-phrase) (2015)

A cute passphrase generator using space words.

 - [github repository](https://github.com/natronics/space-phrase)


## [Science Hack Day SF 2014](science-hack-day-2014)

I was at SHD San Fransisco 2014 and [worked on these projects](science-hack-day-2014)

## [NASA Style Switch Guards](NASA-switch-guard) (2013)

A 3D-printable version of NASA's awesome looking toggle switch guards so you don't accidentally hit a switch in orbit.

## [Earth Observatory Photos](EOL-Photos) (2013)

Now defunct. Was an attempt at a photo browser for NASA's Earth Observation Laboratory.

 - Legacy instance: <http://eol-browser.herokuapp.com/>
 - [github repository](https://github.com/natronics/EOL-Photos)


## Mars Science laboratory Image Feed (2012)

Now defunct. I put this together in an afternoon to track new images coming from
MSL after she landed. It worked for a little bit, but JPL kept changing their
layout and I couldn't keep up with the scraper.
